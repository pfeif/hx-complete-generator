# hx-complete-generator

This code is used to generate the hx-complete extension. If you are looking for
the extension, please see one of the following according to your preferences.

- [GitHub][github]
- [Visual Studio Marketplace][visual-studio-marketplace]
- [Open VSX Registry][open-vsx-registry]

If you're interested in looking through some Python code that parses GitHub
releases or generates HTML data for use with VS Code, go for it. I tried to
keep it simple.

## License

This code is licensed under the very permissive, open-source BSD-3 Clause
license. Details can be found in [`LICENSE.md`](./LICENSE.md).

The TL;DR of the license is that you can do whatever you want with the extension
so long as you don't claim I endorse it.
